# Search Functionality Implementation Summary

## Overview
Search functionality has been successfully implemented and tested for the NEAR Lightweight Block Explorer. The implementation includes a search bar on the home page and dedicated routes for viewing transaction details.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Search Bar (Home Page)
- **Location**: Main home page (`/pages/Home.tsx`)
- **Features**:
  - Universal search box that accepts:
    - Block numbers (numeric, e.g., `220652769`)
    - Block hashes (alphanumeric strings)
    - Transaction hashes (base58 strings, typically 44+ characters)
  - Automatic routing based on input type detection
  - Clean, modern UI integrated with the existing design

### 2. Transaction Detail Page
- **Route**: `/tx/:hash`
- **File**: `/pages/TransactionDetail.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Displays comprehensive transaction information
  - Shows transaction status (Success/Failed)
  - Displays sender, receiver, actions, gas usage, logs
  - Full raw transaction JSON viewer

### 3. RPC Methods
- **Files Updated**:
  - `/lib/nearRpc.ts`
  - `/lib/nearRpcFailover.ts`
- **New Method**: `getTransactionByHash(txHash, accountId?)`
  - Uses NEAR's `EXPERIMENTAL_tx_status` RPC method
  - Requires sender account ID (NEAR protocol limitation)

## Current Limitations

### Transaction Search Requires Sender Account ID
**Important**: NEAR's RPC protocol does not support looking up transactions by hash alone. The `EXPERIMENTAL_tx_status` method requires both:
1. Transaction hash
2. Sender account ID (the account that signed/sent the transaction)

**Why This Limitation Exists**:
- This is a fundamental limitation of NEAR's RPC design
- NEAR stores transactions indexed by account ID, not just by hash
- This is different from blockchains like Ethereum where you can look up transactions by hash alone

**Workaround Implemented**:
When a user searches for a transaction hash, the app:
1. Attempts to fetch the transaction
2. If it fails (sender account ID not provided), shows a helpful UI that:
   - Explains why the sender account ID is needed
   - Provides an input field for the user to enter the sender account ID
   - Includes a link to NEAR's official block explorer (nearblocks.io) as an alternative

## Testing Results

### âœ… What Works
1. **Block Number Search**: Tested with block `220652769` - successfully displays full block details
2. **Search Bar UI**: Clean, intuitive interface on home page
3. **Network Switching**: Works seamlessly with localnet, testnet, and mainnet
4. **Transaction Route**: Properly navigates to `/tx/:hash` route
5. **Error Handling**: Provides clear, helpful error messages

### ðŸ“‹ What Was Tested
- Browser testing via Playwright
- Search functionality for blocks
- Transaction hash routing
- Network switching (localnet â†’ testnet)
- Error messages and user guidance

## How to Use

### Searching for Blocks
1. Enter a block number (e.g., `220652769`) in the search box
2. Click "Search" or press Enter
3. View full block details including chunks, timestamp, author, etc.

### Searching for Transactions
1. Enter a transaction hash in the search box
2. Click "Search" or press Enter
3. **If you know the sender account**:
   - Enter the sender account ID when prompted
   - Click "Look Up Transaction"
   - View full transaction details
4. **If you don't know the sender account**:
   - Click the provided link to view on nearblocks.io
   - Or check your transaction history to find the sender account

## Technical Implementation

### Search Logic
```typescript
const handleSearch = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  const query = searchQuery.trim();
  if (!query) return;

  // Check if it's a block number (numeric)
  if (/^\d+$/.test(query)) {
    setLocation(`/block/${query}`);
    return;
  }

  // Check if it's a transaction hash (base58 string, typically 44 chars)
  if (query.length >= 40 && /^[A-Za-z0-9]+$/.test(query)) {
    setLocation(`/tx/${query}`);
    return;
  }

  // Otherwise, assume it's a block hash
  setLocation(`/block/${query}`);
};
```

### Transaction Lookup with Account ID
```typescript
async getTransactionByHash(txHash: string, accountId?: string): Promise<any> {
  if (!accountId) {
    throw new Error(
      'Sender account ID required. NEAR RPC requires the sender account ID to look up transactions.'
    );
  }
  return this.call('EXPERIMENTAL_tx_status', [txHash, accountId]);
}
```

## Files Modified
1. `/pages/Home.tsx` - Added search bar component
2. `/pages/App.tsx` - Added `/tx/:hash` route
3. `/pages/TransactionDetail.tsx` - New file for transaction detail view
4. `/lib/nearRpc.ts` - Added `getTransactionByHash` method
5. `/lib/nearRpcFailover.ts` - Added `getTransactionByHash` method

## Future Enhancements
To overcome the sender account ID limitation, consider:
1. **Indexer Integration**: Use NEAR's indexer service which supports hash-only lookups
2. **Local Cache**: Build a local index of transactions as they're discovered
3. **URL Parameters**: Support `/tx/:hash/:accountId` route format for direct links
4. **Account History**: Add account transaction history viewer

## Example Transaction Hash
The user requested to search for: `7z57ZkZEp4vJmr2NjazvVXFyFWPunWAPQPypkhRCHyF5`

To look this up, the sender account ID would be needed. Without an indexer, this is a limitation of the RPC-based approach.

## Screenshots
See:
- `home-page-with-search.png` - Home page with search bar
- `transaction-search-ui.png` - Transaction detail page with sender account prompt
- `block-search-working.png` - Successful block search result

## Conclusion
The search functionality is fully implemented and working for blocks. Transaction search is implemented but requires the sender account ID due to NEAR protocol limitations. Clear user guidance is provided when this information is needed.
