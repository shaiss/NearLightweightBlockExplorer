# Network Selector Feature Guide

## Overview

The NEAR Lightweight Block Explorer now includes a network selector that ensures you only connect to one blockchain network at a time. This prevents the common mistake of mixing RPC endpoints from different networks.

## How It Works

### Network Types

The explorer supports three distinct networks:

1. **Mainnet** - The production NEAR blockchain
2. **Testnet** - The official test blockchain for NEAR development
3. **Localnet** - Local NEAR node (default, usually on localhost:3030)

### Network Isolation

Once you select a network:
- ‚úÖ Only RPC providers for that network are shown
- ‚úÖ Only providers from the selected network can be enabled
- ‚úÖ Custom providers are added to the selected network
- ‚úÖ All queries use providers from the selected network only
- ‚úÖ Settings are automatically saved and restored

**You can never accidentally query multiple networks simultaneously.**

## Using the Network Selector

### Accessing the Network Selector

The network selector is prominently displayed in the main navigation bar at the top of the app:

```
[Logo] [Blocks] [Search] [Settings] [Localnet ‚ñº]
                                      ‚Üë Network selector
```

### Switching Networks

1. Click the **network name button** in the top-right corner
2. A dropdown menu appears showing three options:
   - Mainnet
   - Testnet
   - Localnet
3. Click the network you want to switch to
4. The app immediately:
   - Switches to the new network
   - Refreshes the provider list
   - Reloads with providers for that network
   - Saves your choice in localStorage

### Current Network Display

The current network is always visible:

- **Navigation**: Shows selected network name (e.g., "localnet")
- **Settings Page**: Displays "Configure RPC providers for [NETWORK] network"
- **Color Indicator**: Selected network is highlighted in blue in the dropdown menu
- **Footer**: Provider status shows current RPC node in use

## Provider Management Per Network

### Default Providers

When you switch to each network, these providers are available by default:

#### Mainnet
- NEAR Official (enabled by default)
- FastNEAR (enabled by default)
- Pagoda
- Aurora
- Lava Network

#### Testnet
- NEAR Testnet Official (enabled by default)
- FastNEAR Testnet
- Pagoda Testnet

#### Localnet
- Localhost:3030 (enabled by default)

### Customization Per Network

Each network has its own configuration:

1. **Settings Page** shows only providers for the selected network
2. **Add Custom Provider** adds it to the current network
3. **Enable/Disable** toggles are per-network
4. **Provider Priority** (‚Üë‚Üì) is per-network

### Example: Switching Contexts

```
User Actions:
1. Using Localnet (localhost:3030)
   - Working on local development
   - Testing smart contracts

2. Click "Testnet" in network selector
   - Settings page shows testnet providers
   - Previous localnet configuration is saved
   - Now querying testnet RPC nodes

3. Click "Mainnet" in network selector
   - Settings page shows mainnet providers
   - Previous testnet configuration is saved
   - Now querying mainnet RPC nodes

4. Click "Localnet" in network selector
   - Returns to previous localnet configuration
   - All customizations preserved
   - Back to querying localhost
```

## Network Selection Persistence

Your network choice is **automatically saved** and persists across:

- ‚úÖ Page refreshes
- ‚úÖ Browser tab closures (within the same session)
- ‚úÖ Returning to the app later
- ‚ùå Private/Incognito windows (fresh start each time)

### Storage Details

Network selection is stored in localStorage:
- Key: `near_rpc_network`
- Value: `'mainnet' | 'testnet' | 'localnet'`
- Default: `'localnet'` (on first visit)

To reset to default: Clear browser localStorage or click "Reset to Defaults" in Settings.

## Important Rules

### ‚úÖ Always True
- **One network per session** - Only one network is active at any given time
- **Network isolation** - No mixing of providers from different networks
- **Consistent state** - All settings respect the selected network
- **Provider safety** - Can't accidentally query wrong network

### ‚ùå Never Happens
- Queries to multiple networks simultaneously
- Mixing mainnet and testnet endpoints
- Mixing testnet and localnet endpoints
- Losing network selection on refresh

## Common Use Cases

### Local Development
```
1. Select "Localnet"
2. Ensure "Localhost:3030" is enabled
3. Start your local NEAR node
4. Explorer queries your local node
5. Test and develop locally
```

### Testnet Testing
```
1. Select "Testnet" from network selector
2. Settings page shows testnet providers
3. Enable preferred testnet RPC providers
4. Test contracts on testnet
5. All queries go to testnet only
```

### Mainnet Viewing
```
1. Select "Mainnet" from network selector
2. Settings page shows mainnet providers
3. Use default or custom mainnet RPC endpoints
4. View mainnet blocks and transactions
5. Read-only querying of production network
```

### Switching Between Networks
```
Start in Mainnet
  ‚Üì
  Click "Testnet" button
  ‚Üì
All customizations for Mainnet are saved
  ‚Üì
Switch to Testnet providers
  ‚Üì
Make changes to Testnet settings
  ‚Üì
Click "Mainnet" button
  ‚Üì
All Mainnet customizations restored
  ‚Üì
Switch back to Mainnet providers
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Settings Lost After Switching Networks

**Solution**: Settings are saved per-network. When you switch back to a network, your previous settings for that network are restored.

### Issue: "No Providers Configured" Error

**This can happen if:**
1. You switched to a new network for the first time
2. All providers for that network are disabled

**Solution:**
1. Go to Settings
2. Click "Select All" to enable all providers for the current network
3. Try again

### Issue: Queries Failing After Network Switch

**Solutions:**
1. Verify at least one provider is enabled for the network
2. Click "Test" on a provider to check connectivity
3. Ensure the RPC endpoint is accessible
4. For localhost: verify your local NEAR node is running

### Issue: Network Selection Not Saving

**This may occur in:**
1. Private/Incognito windows (localStorage disabled)
2. Browser with storage disabled
3. Very old browser versions

**Solution**: Use a normal (non-private) browser window with storage enabled.

## Technical Details

### Network Type Definition

```typescript
export type NetworkType = 'mainnet' | 'testnet' | 'localnet';
```

### API Usage

```typescript
import { providerManager } from '@/lib/providerManager';

// Get current network
const network = providerManager.getSelectedNetwork();
// Returns: 'mainnet' | 'testnet' | 'localnet'

// Switch network
providerManager.setSelectedNetwork('testnet');

// Get providers for current network
const providers = providerManager.getAllProviders();

// Get enabled providers for current network
const enabledProviders = providerManager.getEnabledProviders();
```

### Data Flow

```
Network Selector Click
    ‚Üì
providerManager.setSelectedNetwork(network)
    ‚Üì
localStorage updated
    ‚Üì
subscribed listeners notified
    ‚Üì
Settings page refreshes provider list
    ‚Üì
failover client uses new network's providers
    ‚Üì
All subsequent queries use selected network
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always check current network** before making queries
   - Look at the navigation bar to see selected network
   - Check the footer to see active RPC provider

2. **Test providers after switching networks**
   - Use the "Test" button in Settings
   - Verify at least one provider is healthy

3. **Enable multiple providers per network**
   - Provides failover redundancy
   - At least 2 providers recommended

4. **Use localnet for development**
   - Default network ensures safe local testing
   - Prevents accidental mainnet queries

5. **Clear custom providers when switching networks**
   - Remove test endpoints from production networks
   - Keep production endpoints separate from dev

## Key Differences from Previous Version

| Feature | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Network Selection | Implicit (based on enabled providers) | **Explicit (dedicated selector)** |
| Network Mixing | Possible to mix networks | **Impossible (prevents mixing)** |
| Provider UI | Grouped by network in one view | **Only shows current network** |
| Accidental Queries | Could query wrong network | **Prevented by design** |
| Settings Persistence | Per provider only | **Per network + per provider** |
| User Experience | Confusing network choices | **Clear network context** |

## Summary

The network selector ensures:
- üéØ **Clear context** - Always know which network you're using
- üîí **Network isolation** - Never accidentally mix networks
- üíæ **Smart persistence** - Settings saved per network
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Safety by design** - Impossible to query multiple networks

This is a critical feature for avoiding expensive mistakes when working with blockchain networks!
