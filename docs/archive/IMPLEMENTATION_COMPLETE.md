## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Multi-Network Support
- **Mainnet** - NEAR mainnet providers from docs
- **Testnet** - NEAR testnet providers from docs
- **Localnet** - Local RPC endpoints (default localhost:3030)
- **Custom** - User-added RPC providers
- **Network Isolation** - Only one network active at a time (NO mixing)

### 2. Provider Management
- Fetch providers from GitHub on app startup
- Cache in localStorage for offline use
- Enable/disable providers per network
- Add custom providers with URL validation
- Remove custom providers
- Test provider connectivity with health check

### 3. Automatic Failover
- Detect network errors (timeout, CORS, connection issues)
- Retry with exponential backoff (3 attempts max)
- Switch to next provider automatically
- Continue until success or all providers exhausted
- Distinguish between network and RPC errors (don't failover on RPC errors)

### 4. User Configuration
- Select active network (Mainnet/Testnet/Localnet)
- Choose which providers to use
- Add custom RPC endpoints
- Test provider health
- View current provider status
- All preferences saved to localStorage

### 5. Real-time Updates
- Network changes immediately reflected
- Provider status updates in header
- Failover notifications (via events)
- Health status indicators
- Subscribe/unsubscribe pattern for components

## Test Results

### Linting
✅ No linter errors
✅ TypeScript compilation successful
✅ All imports resolved correctly

### Functionality

✅ Failover triggers on network errors
✅ Retry logic with backoff functions
✅ Custom providers can be added
✅ Provider health testing works
✅ Settings page fully functional
✅ Network selector in header works
✅ Home page displays current provider
✅ All pages navigate correctly

### User Experience
✅ Clean, intuitive Settings UI
✅ Network selector easy to find and use
✅ Toast notifications provide feedback
✅ Real-time updates on changes

✅ Error messages helpful

## Integration Status

### Components Using Failover
- ✅ Home.tsx - Status fetching
- ✅ BlockList.tsx - Block queries
- ✅ BlockDetail.tsx - Block queries
- ✅ TransactionList.tsx - Transaction queries
- ✅ Search.tsx - Search queries
- ✅ All other pages - Transparent fallback

### Services Using Failover
- ✅ nearRpc instance used globally
- ✅ Backward compatible with old API
- ✅ Automatic failover on all RPC calls
- ✅ Event system for monitoring

## Error Handling

### Network Errors (Handled)
- ✅ Connection timeout → Retry + Failover
- ✅ Connection refused → Retry + Failover
- ✅ CORS errors → Retry + Failover
- ✅ DNS failures → Retry + Failover

### RPC Errors (Not Failovered)
- ✅ Invalid method → Return error
- ✅ Invalid params → Return error
- ✅ Auth required → Return error
- ✅ Block not found → Return error

## Known Limitations

1. **CORS with External Providers**
   - External RPC endpoints may not allow browser requests
   - Solution: Use CORS proxy or local node

2. **Provider Health Tracking**
   - Health status resets on page refresh
   - Could be enhanced to persist to localStorage

3. **Request Caching**
   - No request-level caching (transparent failover only)
   - Could be added for performance optimization

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

1. **Advanced Metrics**
   - Track response times per provider
   - Auto-reorder by performance
   - Display provider statistics

2. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**
   - Prevent cascading failures
   - Auto-disable unhealthy providers

3. **Request Caching**
   - Cache blocks/transactions
   - Reduce API calls during outages

4. **GraphQL Support**
   - Alternative query interface
   - Subscription support

5. **Multi-Chain Support**
   - Extend to other blockchains
   - Shared infrastructure

## Deployment Checklist

## Configuration Notes

### Provider Sources
- GitHub: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/near/docs/master/docs/api/rpc/providers.md
- Fallback: Hardcoded provider list in code
- Custom: User-added via Settings page

### Storage Keys
- `near_rpc_providers` - Provider list cache
- `near_rpc_custom_providers` - Custom providers
- `near_rpc_enabled_providers` - Enabled provider IDs
- `near_rpc_network` - Selected network

### Default Configuration
- Network: Localnet
- Provider: localhost:3030
- Retry attempts: 3
- Initial backoff: 100ms
- Backoff multiplier: 3x

## Support & Maintenance

### Troubleshooting Guide
See `RPC_FAILOVER_IMPLEMENTATION.md` section "Troubleshooting" for:
- CORS error solutions
- Provider health checking
- Network switching issues
- localStorage clearing

### Monitoring
To monitor failover activity:
```typescript
import { nearRpc } from '@/lib/nearRpcFailover';

nearRpc.onFailoverEvent((event) => {
  console.log('Failover event:', event);
  // event.type: 'provider-switch' | 'retry' | 'error' | 'success'
  // event.providerId, event.error, etc.
});
```

## Conclusion

The RPC failover implementation is complete, thoroughly tested, and ready for production use. The system provides:

- **Reliability** through automatic failover and retry logic
- **Flexibility** with multi-network support and custom providers
- **User Control** via intuitive Settings page
- **Transparency** with backward-compatible API
- **Extensibility** for future enhancements

All requirements from the original specification have been met or exceeded.
