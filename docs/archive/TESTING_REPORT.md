2. ✅ All tested features work reliably and perform well
3. ✅ No blocking issues for basic block exploration use case

### For Future Enhancements
1. Add transaction detail view (if RPC supports it)
2. Implement account balance display
3. Add contract interaction capabilities
4. Consider caching for better performance
5. Add dark mode support
6. Implement proper account search testing
7. Add export functionality (CSV/JSON) for block data

### For Deployment
1. The app can be deployed to any static hosting (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
2. Consider environment-based RPC configuration
3. Add rate limiting handling for production
4. Monitor RPC endpoint availability
